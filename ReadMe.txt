#Trivia
A weird and pointless trivia game. Not for the faint of heart or people who dislike pandas.
DISCLAIMER
I was up really early watching something weird on TV and scrolling through the internet when I came up with these questions. 
In no way do they reflect my personal views, beliefs, opinions, thoughts, feelings, cereal choices or movie preferences. 

Good luck
